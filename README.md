# mvn-devops

A modular DevOps framework for Maven projects, written in plain Bash.

You pick the tools from a menu, mvn-devops starts them in Docker, configures
them (admin passwords, tokens, repositories) and turns the stages they
contribute into a pipeline for the orchestrator you chose: plain `mvn` on your
machine, Jenkins or Concourse.

```
$ mvn-devops/devops.sh init

Pipeline orchestrator (choose one)
  1) concourse        Concourse CI in Docker: a ci job on every push, a manual cd job
  2) jenkins          Jenkins in Docker, configured as code (no setup wizard)
  3) maven            Run the stages with mvn directly on this machine
  > [1]: 2

Code quality (choose any, comma separated, 0 for none)
  1) sonarqube        Static code analysis (SonarQube Community + PostgreSQL)
  > [0]: 1

Artifact repositories (choose any, comma separated, 0 for none)
  1) github-packages  Deploy to the Maven registry of the GitHub repository
  2) jfrog            JFrog Artifactory OSS + PostgreSQL
  3) nexus            Sonatype Nexus 3 for Maven releases and snapshots
  > [0]: 1,3
...
```

- **No changes to your pom.** Plugins are called by their coordinates and
  credentials come from the framework's own settings file.
- **Nothing to click.** Admin passwords, tokens, repositories, the Jenkins job
  and the Concourse pipeline are created for you.
- **Shared by the team.** The tools and answers are kept in a committed
  `devops.conf`; passwords and tokens stay on each machine.
- **Anywhere.** Each tool runs in Docker on your machine or a VM, or is an
  existing server with its own URL.

## Prerequisites

Bash 4+ (Linux, macOS, or Git Bash on Windows), Docker with the compose
plugin, `curl`, `jq`, `git` and `ssh-keygen`, plus Java and Maven when the
pipeline runs on your machine. `devops.sh doctor` checks them; install
commands per system are in [docs/prerequisites.md](docs/prerequisites.md).

## Install

mvn-devops is meant to live inside the project, like the Maven wrapper. From
the project root:

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/oss-community/mvn-devops/releases/download/v1.0.0/mvn-devops-1.0.0.zip
unzip -q mvn-devops-1.0.0.zip && mv mvn-devops-1.0.0 mvn-devops && rm mvn-devops-1.0.0.zip
git add mvn-devops && git commit -m "Add mvn-devops 1.0.0"
```

Later, `mvn-devops/devops.sh upgrade` replaces it with the latest release.
Windows steps, the deb and rpm packages, and notes on line endings are in
[docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md).

## Quick start

Create the GitHub token first ([docs/github-setup.md](docs/github-setup.md)),
then from the project root:

```bash
mvn-devops/devops.sh setup      # menu, questions, containers, tokens, pipeline
mvn-devops/devops.sh run        # run the pipeline
mvn-devops/devops.sh urls       # web consoles and how to log in
```

On Windows use `mvn-devops\devops.bat` instead. Commit the `devops.conf` that
`setup` writes: a teammate who clones the project runs the same `setup` and is
only asked for their own passwords, tokens and user names. Passwords, tokens
and generated files go to `.devops/`, which keeps itself out of git.

`setup` is these five steps; each can also be run on its own:

| Step | Command | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `init` | Menu per category. Saves the choice in `devops.conf`. |
| 2 | `secrets` | Each selected module asks for the values it needs. Passwords default to random ones. |
| 3 | `up` | Modules prepare (config files, keys), then `docker compose up` with the selected tools. |
| 4 | `configure` | Modules finish their tool: replace default admin passwords, create tokens and repositories. |
| 5 | `publish` | The orchestrator renders the pipeline and installs it (Jenkins job, Concourse pipeline, local script). |

Or start from a ready-made pipeline, a tested combination of tools, and
answer only for your GitHub user and token
([docs/pipelines.md](docs/pipelines.md)):

```bash
mvn-devops/devops.sh pipelines
mvn-devops/devops.sh setup --pipeline jenkins-sonarqube-nexus
```

Without questions, for scripts and CI:

```bash
mvn-devops/devops.sh -y init --orchestrator jenkins --with sonarqube,nexus,github-pages
mvn-devops/devops.sh -y setup
```

[examples/hello-maven](examples/hello-maven) is a small project to try it on.

## Commands

| Command | |
|---|---|
| `init [--orchestrator X --with a,b \| --pipeline name]` | choose modules, or a ready-made pipeline |
| `pipelines` | list the ready-made pipelines |
| `setup [--pipeline name]` | init (if needed) + secrets + up + configure + publish |
| `secrets [--reconfigure]` | ask for values; `--reconfigure` asks again |
| `up`, `configure`, `publish` | single setup steps |
| `stages` | the ordered stages contributed by the selected modules |
| `render` | write pipeline files into `.devops/generated` |
| `run` | run the pipeline. maven: `--dry-run`, `--from <stage>`, `--only <stage>`, `--phase ci\|cd`. concourse: `--phase ci\|cd`. Every orchestrator: `--phase <environment>` approves an environment |
| `rollback [environment] [--to TAG]` | put the previous image back, in the last environment by default |
| `release [--version X] [--next Y] [--dry-run] [--no-push]` | release the project ([docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md)) |
| `status`, `urls`, `logs [service]`, `compose ...` | operations |
| `down` | stop containers, keep data |
| `destroy` | remove containers and volumes, the deploy key and webhook on GitHub, optionally the stored values |
| `export-compose [dir]` | write one `docker-compose.yml` and its `.env` for the selected tools |
| `env [--show\|--windows]` | regenerate env files; `--show` masks secrets; `--windows` writes a `setx` script for IDEs |
| `get <KEY>` | print one stored value, e.g. `get SONAR_ADMIN_PASSWORD` |
| `modules`, `doctor [--fix]` | list modules, check prerequisites; `--fix` repairs CRLF line endings |
| `upgrade [--version X] [--check]` | replace the copy of mvn-devops inside the project with a release |
